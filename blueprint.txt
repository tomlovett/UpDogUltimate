gameOps interface:
- load rosters
- pass on-field events to factories

Settings interface:
- add player form
- edit player: display all players, interface
- edit team: players on/not-on, interface

Stats:
- display individual stats via ng-repeat

Factory:
- parsePoint()
later:
  - create player
  - edit player: attributes, team affiliations


Long-term:


- storing data between sessions
- how to get working prototypes out to my friends
- pre-loading data into factories
- learning $route

Make it functional first. Track individual scores and point-data for one game at a time. 
Live stats later. Data analysis later. The ng-click expandPlayer() can be for later. Functional first. parsePoint()

Make it work, then make it better.
